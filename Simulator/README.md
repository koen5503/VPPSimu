# NED Baseload Power Simulation

This project is a Python-based Streamlit dashboard designed to simulate a renewable energy system meeting a baseload power target. It integrates historical capacity factor data for Solar, Onshore Wind, and Offshore Wind with a configurable storage system (Li-ion Battery and Hydrogen) to analyze system reliability and energy balance.

## Features

### 1. Data Ingestion & Time Selection

* **Historical Data**: Loads combined renewable energy data from `energy_data_ned.xlsx` (generated by the NED Data Retrieval tool).
* **Continuous Simulation**: stitches multiple years of data into a continuous time-series.
* **Precise Time Selection**: Allows users to define specific start and end dates/times for granular analysis (e.g., analyzing specific "Dunkelflaute" events).

### 2. Configurable Simulation Logic

* **Baseload Target**: Set a constant power demand (GW) to be met by the system.
* **Generation Mix**: Configure installed capacities (GW) for Solar, Wind Onshore, and Wind Offshore.
* **Storage Hierarchy**:
  * **Li-ion Battery** (Short-term): Higher efficiency (95%), prioritized for charging/discharging.
  * **Hydrogen (H2)** (Long-term): Lower efficiency (Ely 70% / FC 50%), used when batteries are full (charging) or empty (discharging).
* **Energy Balance Logic**:
  * *Surplus*: Charge Battery $\to$ Charge H2 $\to$ Curtailment.
  * *Deficit*: Discharge Battery $\to$ Discharge H2 $\to$ Loss of Load.

### 3. Interactive Visualizations

* **Dashboard KPIs**: Real-time metrics for Reliability (%), Total Curtailment (TWh), and Storage Cycles.
* **Annual Energy Summary**: A dedicated table showing total TWh generated, charged, discharged, and lost per year.
* **Power Balance Graph**:
  * **Stacked Area Mode**: Visualizes the mix of supply (Gen + Discharge) vs. demand (Charge + Curtailment).
  * **Line Mode**: Non-stacked interaction allowing individual trace comparison.
  * **Download**: Native PNG download support.
* **Storage Levels**: Dual-axis chart tracking Battery and Hydrogen State of Charge (SoC) %.

## Requirements

This project requires a Python environment (3.10+) with the following packages:

* **Streamlit**: For the interactive web dashboard.
* **Pandas**: For data manipulation and time-series handling.
* **Page**: For numerical operations.
* **Plotly**: For interactive charting.
* **OpenPyxl**: For reading Excel files.

## Installation & Usage

1. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install streamlit pandas numpy plotly openpyxl
    ```

2. **Ensure Data Availability**:
    Place `energy_data_ned.xlsx` in the same directory. This file should contain hourly capacity factor data (columns: `Solar`, `Wind Onshore`, `Wind Offshore`) in year-based sheets (e.g., `Y2023`).

3. **Run the Dashboard**:

    ```bash
    streamlit run simulation_dashboard.py
    ```
